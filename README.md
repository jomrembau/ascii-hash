Custom Password Hash Exercise

This Python script is part of a class exercise to implement a custom hashing algorithm for the password "passwort". The password is split into two blocks, and each character’s ASCII value is multiplied by a sequence of multipliers. Cumulative sums are calculated to generate a decimal hash, which is then converted to a hexadecimal string.

The output displays:

* Each character

* ASCII value

* Multiplier

* Product (ASCII × multiplier)

* Running decimal hash

* Hexadecimal representation


Disclaimer: This hashing algorithm was implemented as a class exercise. It is not secure and should not be used for real password storage or any security-critical applications.
